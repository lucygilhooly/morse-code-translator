This is a translator which translates plain english into morse code.

It was built using HTML and javascript, there has been no styling added yet this will be a future addition.

how it works is you just input what you would like to translate and hit the enter key and your morse code translation will appear below.

I originally planned to use an object to store my alphabet in english and morse code but was struggling to gain functionality this way so changed to a more familiar method of storing within arrays.

It was my first time using the onchange in my HTML document and it allowed me to use the enter key to perform the event aka the translation.

improvements i would like to make are: 
- adding a button to to the page
- adding styling to make it more aesthetically pleasing 
- adding an option to translate from morse to english
